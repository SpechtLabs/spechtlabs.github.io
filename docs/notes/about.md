## Hi, I'm Cedric

Most people know me as **cedi**.

I'm a **Staff Site Reliability Engineer and Technical Lead** at [Celonis](https://www.celonis.com), where I focus on building resilient distributed systems that scale.

I specialize in building and maintaining **large scale distributed systems** that serve hundreds of millions of users, with deep expertise in chaos engineering, observability, and resilience testing. My passion lies in making systems more reliable, teams more effective, and turning incidents into learning opportunities.

With **13 years** of experience in Software Engineering and Site Reliability Engineering, I've designed and operated **distributed systems at global scale** (across millions of servers), led critical infrastructure migrations for major cloud platforms, and built reliability practices that have become organizational standards at companies like Microsoft Azure.

## Engineering Philosophy

::: tip Core Principle
**Be excellent to each other** ü§ù
:::

::: note Focus Areas

- Focus on **fundamentals** over chasing hype
- Alert on **symptoms**, not vitals
- **Incidents are learning opportunities**
- There is no single "root cause"
:::

::: details Essential Reading & Frameworks

- [How Complex Systems Fail](https://how.complexsystems.fail) is required reading
- System architecture exists mostly **in your head** and fails differently than expected
- Recommend the [Above/Below the Line framework](https://snafucatchers.github.io/#2_3_The_above-the-line/below-the-line_framework) for incident analysis
